I'm hanging on to the other side
I won't give up 'til the end of me

[Interlude]
Go!
Yeah!

[Refrain]
Welcome to the mind of a different kind
Where we've been growing slowly
Think I'm on eleven, but I'm on a nine
Guess you don't really know me
Running from the past is a losing game
It never brings you glory
Been down this road before
Already know this story

[Pre-Chorus]
(Face your fear!)
(Face your fear!)

[Chorus]
It's time to face your fear
'Cause when your time has come and gonе
I'll be the one to carry on (Carry on)
And you can throw mе to the wolves (Throw me to the wolves)
'Cause I am undefeatable
I'm hanging on to the other side
I won't give up 'til the end of me
I'm what you get when the stars collide
Now face it, you're just an enemy

[Post-Chorus]
(Woah, woah)
You're crossing the line
(Woah, woah)
Now we've run out of time
(Woah, woah)
I'll take what is mine

[Interlude]
Hrmm (Go!)

[Bridge]
And when the story ends
It becomes a part of me
I've given what it takes
I'll find another way
I used to never know
But now it's crystal clear!
This feeling's just a ghost

[Chorus]
It's time to face your fear
'Cause when your time has come and gone
I'll be the one to carry on (Carry on)
And you can throw me to the wolves (Throw me to the wolves)

I won't give up 'til the end of me
